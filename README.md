### Truffles Collector

Truffles Collector is a mobile-optimized game made with javascript. The object of the game is to figure out what numbers are assigned to the four clickable truffles, and then click the truffles to increment your score until you reach the target number!

Upon winning or losing an alert box will appear in your browser letting you know, and your wins or losses counter will be incremented by 1. 

The game has been coded in such a way such that the value of one of the truffles will never be the value of the target number, and the value of the truffles will never go below 10. It is not guaranteed that winning the game will be possible given a certain array of numbers given.

###TODO:

* implement a game mechanic that changes the values of a given truffle after three clicks of that truffle
* implement a more elegant way to give feedback to the player than the current alert messsages which are jarring and not best practice
